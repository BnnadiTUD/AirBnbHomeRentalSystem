# AirBnbHomeRentalSystem
I took inspiration from my lecture notes, my eCollege resources and some youtube tutorials to make a program that lets a user rent and return homes, kind of like AirBnb.
A user is able to choose a house from a list and rent it out for as mant days as they want and retur it by choosing between menu options.
The project has 4 classes Home, Rental, Customer and the driver class
